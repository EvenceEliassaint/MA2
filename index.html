                <h2>We Might Be Falling In Love</h2>
                <p>Victoria Monet Ft Bryson Tiller</p>
                <p>Why I Love the Song: This is by far my FAVORITE SONG right now sang by my favorite artist. The Lyrics are creative, soft, and fun to sing along. Also the melody and flow is very peaceful and feels like a warm hug. All around this song gives me so much joy and really calms me down.</p>

                <h2>This Love</h2>
                <p>Maroon 5</p>
                <p>Why I Love the Song: As a HUGE Maroon 5 fan, I throughly enjoy everything they put out. But there is something special in this song. The smooth guitar melody will make you bop your head no matter what mood you are in. The lyrics (although a little sad) are fun to sing along too. All in all, this song is very catchy and a song I sing in the shower DAILY.</p>

                <h2>Feel It Still</h2>
                <p>Portugual, The Man</p>
                <p>>Why I Love the Song: This song makes me feel like I'm in a race movie. I love the feeling that this song gives me in my soul. It really feels like a high-speed chase and I love it.</p>

                <h2>I Have Nothing</h2>
                <p>Whitney Houston</p>
                <p>Why I Love the Song: This is easily one of the greatest songs to ever be put out. In my opinion, this is Whitney Houston's best body of work. She displays her amazing vocal range in this song and even has an amazing key change to end the song. I love the songs lyrics and although I cant sing like her, it's hard not to sing along with her. This song feels like a beautiful letter and has gotton me thorugh some hard times. That is why I love this song.</p>
